 <p>On the island of Savai'i there was a beautiful princess named Samoa had a pet eel. Over time, the eel feel in love with the princess, and this made her very afriad, so she ran away. But the eel followed her.</p>
</div>



<div id="moon-trees" class="slider">


  <p>He followed her all the way to a neighboring village, where the chiefs beheaded him. The eel vowed to recieve a kiss from the princess before he died. While escorting the princess back to the village,
    the cheifs had told Samoa to put the eel's head in a bag, and to never put it on the ground. But on the journey the princess grew tired and had put the head down to rest.</p>
</div>



<div id="cat-tree" class="slider">
 <p> Once she put the head down, it sunk deep into the ground, and a strange tall tree grew in its place with long green leaves. On the tree grew hard round fruits, with three dots on it that looked like a face,
   and sweet water inside of them.</p>
</div>

  <div id="Moana" class="slider">
    <p> Getting thirsty, the princess and the servants grabed the fruits and poked an opening in on of the holes to drink them. Little did the princess know that this was the eel, and that by putting her mouth on the hole,
      she had forfilled his wish and gave him a kiss.</p>
